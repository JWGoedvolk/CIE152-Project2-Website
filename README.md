# Project Outline
This website is made by Jan-Willem and Leon as a prototype for a uni project. It is a website where you can ask Cody, our mascot, to help you with certain programming problems you might be facing!
The number of problems that Cody can help you with is **very** limited at the moment but will be constantly expanding over time!

# Installing And How To Use
## Installing
1. From the Github website ([link here](https://github.com/JWGoedvolk/CIE152-Project2-Website)), go to the 'Code' tab at the top.
2. Right under this, make sure you are on the 'main' branch.
3. Click on the 'Code' button to the right of the file search bar, and sellect 'Download ZIP'. This should begin downloading a zip folder.
4. After the folder is done installing, open it and extract the contents to wherever you want to put it on your computer.
## How To Run
1. In the extracted folder, open the 'main.html' file. This should have opened the website in a browser.
## How To Use
 1. On the bottom of the website you should find a field to type in, put whatever programming problem you are having here!
 2. If Cody knows of a solution (or multiple solutions!) he will show them in the block of text that just apeared!
 3. NOTE! Cody doesn't have all the answers and bellow you will find a list of problems he does have the answer to. If you have a problem and Cody doesn't seem to have the solution, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/oQfF7f6sMSXW6oU5A).

# Future Plans
Here is a rough list of things I want to do with Cody in the future:
- Add a tab on the website explaning the project more
- Add a tab to send a request to add new problems or solution on the website
- Host the website on a server to automatically update it from Github
- Much more!
